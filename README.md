# XCCTW minecraft server Configuration

## Introduction

This is the configuration for XCCTW minecraft server, which has hosted on `minecraft://mc.xcc.tw` now.

If you want to play, please open your minecraft client and connect to `mc.xcc.tw`.

In this configuration, we use `docker-compose` to manage the server, and use `docker-compose-volume-check.yml` to check the volume.

## How to use

Basically, all server setup was done in `docker-compose.yml`, and you can use `docker-compose` to manage the server.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Most of the required documents are in `itzg/minecraft-server`'s website.

## How to add mods, datapacks, and other things

### mods

We use `mods.txt` to manage mods, and you can add mods' name in it.

### datapacks

Although we can use `datapacks.txt` to manage datapacks, but we don't use it now, since not all datapacks are placed in a solid network location.

That means when server try to download datapacks from the network, it may fail.

So we directly pre-download all datapacks and place them in `datapacks` folder.

### backup

Although we have already added `itzg/mc-backup` to backup the server, but we still need to backup the server manually.

You can use `copy-backup-example.sh` to copy the latest backup to your local computer.

```bash
./copy-backup.sh # alter the example script to your own.
```

## How to remove unused mods, datapacks, and other things

Usually this happened when we remove a mod "A" in `mods.txt`. The mod "A" will still in the `mods` folder, since there's no any integrations can help us apply mod-removal changes automatically. This will cause the server to crash once server's version has upgraded to a newer number but the mod "A" didn't.

So do datapacks.

Therefor, for manually removing unused mods, datapacks, and other things, we may consider to use `docker-compose-volume-check.yml` to modify the volume.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-volume-check.yml up -d
```

This will immediately stop the minecraft server (if running) and initiate a new simple linux server (ubuntu) which has minecraft's volume mounted, and you can modify the volume as you want.
